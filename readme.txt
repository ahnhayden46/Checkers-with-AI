The Checker Game with an AI opponent implemented with minimax algorithm and alpha pruning.

This program aims to implement the game 'Checkers' and an AI player whose intelligence is based on the Minimax evaluation using alpha-beta pruning.

There are 8 classes including Board, Game, Tile, Player, Human, Computer, Piece and Temp. The Board class extending JPanel in Java Swing is the main class and not only visulaises the game board but also keeps updating it by retrieving the game state from the Game class which contains all the other classes.
